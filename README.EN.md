## This repository hosts: 

- the file of the UI Kit v3 in its native Figma format (.fig), also available through the [dedicated Designers Italia project community page](https://figma.com/@designersitalia/), where you can preview, and, contribute to the work in progress by commenting on the entire kit or specific parts; 

- conversion to the [open Sketch format](https://github.com/sketch-hq/sketch-document) (.sketch), automatically made using the latest version of [fig2sketch](https://github.com/sketch-hq/fig2sketch). This conversion is to be considered in a _testing_ state; some features may be missing and/or incorrect; 

- the historical memory of the previous UI Kit v2 version (native Sketch, deprecated), with other archival materials, are in the [branch 2.x](https://github.com/italia/design-ui-kit/tree/2.x).
